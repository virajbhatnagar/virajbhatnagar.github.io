      <description>We, @zerodhaonline just got to 1 crore customers. Looking back, the biggest tipping point was AADHAR for online account opening. Can&amp;rsquo;t thank the Government &amp;amp; SEBI &amp;amp; Exchanges &amp;amp; Depositories enough for making this happen.
A few things we did that had unintended benefits. The plan to rely on word-of-mouth &amp;amp; have a single offering for all customers had benefits that we never thought of at the start. Economies of scale kicked in not just in tech but across support &amp;amp; opsâ€”the team size has remained the same as we went from 20lk to 1cr clients.</description>
