				<p>We, <a href="https://twitter.com/Zerodhaonline">@zerodhaonline</a> just got to 1 crore customers.
Looking back, the biggest tipping point was AADHAR  for online account opening. Can&rsquo;t thank the Government &amp; SEBI &amp; Exchanges &amp; Depositories enough for making this happen.</p>
<p>A few things we did that had unintended benefits.
The plan to rely on word-of-mouth &amp; have a single offering for all customers had benefits that we never thought of at the start.
Economies of scale kicked in not just in tech but across support &amp; ops—the team size has remained the same as we went from 20lk to 1cr clients.</p>
<p>When customers are introduced by family or friends who are existing clients, they also tend to help bridge the knowledge gap about the platform at the start. A huge challenge for consumer apps in a complex business like ours. Can&rsquo;t thank our customers enough for this.</p>

This meant no spam calls, emails or push notifications to open accounts or trigger trades. This also helped us gain credibility, the biggest challenge in broking business.</p>
